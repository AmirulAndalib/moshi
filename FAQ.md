# FAQ

Here is the answer to a number of frequently asked questions.

### Will you release training code?

We will release some training / fine-tuning code, but we do not have any timeline yet. Please be patient.

### Will you release the dataset?

We will not release the pre-training dataset.

### Is Moshi multilingual?

At the moment no. Moshi only speaks English. It has some basic support for translating some sentences
or words to other languages, but you shouldn't expect to use it fully in any other language than English.

### Can I change Moshi's voice / personality?

This would require fine tuning, which is not currently supported.
