 [Moshi][moshi] is a speech-text foundation model and **full-duplex** spoken dialogue framework.
 It uses [Mimi][moshi], a state-of-the-art streaming neural audio codec. Mimi operates at 12.5 Hz, and compresses
 audio down to 1.1 kbps, in a fully streaming manner (latency of 80ms, the frame size),
 yet performs better than existing, non-streaming, codec like
 [SpeechTokenizer](https://github.com/ZhangXInFD/SpeechTokenizer) (50 Hz, 4 kbps), or [SemantiCodec](https://github.com/haoheliu/SemantiCodec-inference) (50 Hz, 1kbps).

 Moshi models **two streams of audio**: one corresponds to Moshi, and one to the user.
 At inference, the stream from the user is taken from the audio input,
and the one for Moshi is sampled from. Along that, Moshi predicts text tokens corresponding to its own speech, its **inner monologue**,
which greatly improves the quality of its generation. A small depth transformer models inter codebook dependencies for a given step,
while a large, 7B parameter Transformer models the temporal dependencies. Moshi achieves a theoretical latency
of 160ms (80ms for the frame size of Mimi + 80ms of acoustic delay), with a practical overall latency as low as 200ms.

Mimi builds on previous neural audio codecs such as [SoundStream](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03312)
and [EnCodec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec), adding a Transformer both in the encoder and decoder,
and adapting the strides to match an overall frame rate of 12.5 Hz. This allows Mimi to get closer to the
average frame rate of text tokens (~3-4 Hz), and limit the number of auto-regressive steps in Moshi.
Similarly to SpeechTokenizer, Mimi uses a distillation loss so that the first codebook tokens match
a self-supervised representation from [WavLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13900). Interestingly, while
Mimi is fully causal and streaming, it learns to match sufficiently well the non causal representation from WavLM,
without introducing any delays. Finally, and similary to [EBEN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14090), Mimi
uses **only an adversarial training loss**, along with feature matching, showing strong improvements in terms of subjective quality
despite its low bitrate.

## Organisation of the repository

There are three separate versions of the moshi inference stack in this repo.
- The python version using PyTorch is in the [`moshi/`](moshi/) directory.
- The python version using MLX for M series Macs is in the [`moshi_mlx/`](moshi_mlx/) directory.
- The rust version used in production is in the [`rust/`](rust/) directory.
    This contains in particular a Mimi implementation in Rust, with Python bindings available
    as `rustymimi`.

Finally, the code for the live demo is provided in the [`client/`](client/) directory.


## Models

We release three models:
- our speech codec Mimi,
- Moshi fine-tuned on a male synthetic voice (Moshiko),
- Moshi fine-tuned on a female synthetic voice (Moshika).

Depending on the backend, the file format and quantization available will vary. Here is the list
of the HuggingFace repo with each model. Mimi is bundled in any of those, and always use the same checkpoint format.

- Moshika for PyTorch (bf16): [kmhf/moshika-pytorch-bf16](https://huggingface.co/kmhf/moshika-pytorch-bf16).
- Moshiko for PyTorch (bf16): [kmhf/moshiko-pytorch-bf16](https://huggingface.co/kmhf/moshiko-pytorch-bf16).
- Moshika for MLX (int4, int8, bf16): [kmhf/moshiko-mlx-q4](https://huggingface.co/kmhf/moshika-mlx-q4), [kmhf/moshiko-mlx-q8](https://huggingface.co/kmhf/moshika-mlx-q8),  [kmhf/moshiko-mlx-bf16](https://huggingface.co/kmhf/moshika-mlx-bf16).
- Moshiko for MLX (int4, int8, bf16): [kmhf/moshiko-mlx-q4](https://huggingface.co/kmhf/moshiko-mlx-q4), [kmhf/moshiko-mlx-q8](https://huggingface.co/kmhf/moshiko-mlx-q8),  [kmhf/moshiko-mlx-bf16](https://huggingface.co/kmhf/moshiko-mlx-bf16).
- Moshiko for Rust/Candle (int8, bf16): [kmhf/moshika-candle-q8](https://huggingface.co/kmhf/moshika-candle-q8),  [kmhf/moshiko-mlx-bf16](https://huggingface.co/kmhf/moshika-candle-bf16).
- Moshiko for Rust/Candle (int8, bf16): [kmhf/moshiko-candle-q8](https://huggingface.co/kmhf/moshiko-candle-q8),  [kmhf/moshiko-mlx-bf16](https://huggingface.co/kmhf/moshiko-candle-bf16).

## Requirements

You will need at least Python 3.10. For specific requirements, please check the individual backends
directories. You can install the PyTorch and MLX clients with the following:

```bash
pip install moshi      # moshi PyTorch, from PyPI
pip install moshi_mlx  # moshi MLX, from PyPI
# Or the bleeding edge versions for Moshi and Moshi-MLX.
pip install -e "git+https://git@github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi.git#egg=moshi&subdirectory=moshi"
pip install -e "git+https://git@github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi.git#egg=moshi_mlx&subdirectory=moshi_mlx"

pip install rustymimi  # mimi, rust implementation with Python bindings from PyPI
```

While we hope that the present codebase will work on Windows, we do not provide official support for it.
We have tested the MLX version with MacBook Pro M3. At the moment, we do not support quantization
for the PyTorch version, so you will need a GPU with a significant amount of memory (24GB).

For using the rust backend, you will need a recent version of the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/).
To compile GPU support, you will also need the [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) properly installed for your GPU, in particular with `nvcc`.

## Development

If you wish to install from a clone of this repository, maybe to further develop Moshi, you can do the following:
```bash
# From the root of the clone of the repo
pip install -e 'moshi[dev]'
pip install -e 'moshi_mlx[dev]'
pre-commit install
```

If you wish to build locally `rustymimi` (assuming you have Rust properly installed):
```bash
pip install maturin
maturin dev -r -m rust/mimi-pyo3/Cargo.toml
```

## Python (PyTorch)

The Pytorch based API can be found in the `moshi` directory. It provides a streaming
version of the audio tokenizer (mimi) and the lm model (moshi).

In order to run in interactive mode, you need to start a server which will
run the model, you can then use either the web UI or a command line client.

Start the server with:
```bash
python -m moshi.server [--gradio-tunnel] [--hf-repo kmhf/moshika-pytorch-bf16]
```

And then access the web UI on [localhost:8998](http://localhost:8998). If your GPU is on a distant machine
with no direct access, `--gradio-tunnel` will create a tunnel with a URL accessible from anywhere.
Keep in mind that this tunnel goes through the US and can add significant latency (up to 500ms from Europe).
You can use `--gradio-tunnel-token` to set a fixed secret and reuse the same address over time.
Alternatively, you might want to use SSH to redirect your connection.

You can use `--hf-repo` to select a different pretrained model, by setting the proper Hugging Face repository.

Accessing a server that is not localhost via http may cause issues around using
the microphone in the web UI (in some browsers this is only allowed using
https).

A local client is also available, as
```bash
python -m moshi.client [--url URL_TO_GRADIO]
```
However note, that unlike the web browser, this client is bare bone. It doesn't do any echo cancellation,
nor does it try to compensate for a growing lag by skipping frames.

For more information, in particular on how to use the API directly, please
checkout [moshi/README.md](moshi/README.md).

## Python (MLX) for local inference on macOS

Once you have installed `moshi_mlx`, you can run
```bash
python -m moshi_mlx.local -q 4   # weights quantized to 4 bits
python -m moshi_mlx.local -q 8   # weights quantized to 8 bits
# And using a different pretrained model:
python -m moshi_mlx.local -q 4 --hf-repo kmhf/moshika-mlx-q4
python -m moshi_mlx.local -q 8 --hf-repo kmhf/moshika-mlx-q8
# be careful to always match the `-q` and `--hf-repo` flag.
```

This uses a command line interface, which is bare bone. It doesn't do any echo cancellation,
nor does it try to compensate for a growing lag by skipping frames.

Alternatively you can use `python -m moshi_mlx.local_web` to use
the web UI, connection is via http on [localhost:8998](http://localhost:8998).

## Rust

In order to run the rust inference server, use the following command from within
the `rust` directory:

```bash
cargo run --features cuda --bin moshi-backend -r -- --config moshi-backend/config.json standalone
```

When using macOS, you can replace `--features cuda` with `--features metal`.

Alternatively you can use `config-q8.json` rather than `config.json` to use the
quantified q8 model. You can select a different pretrained model, e.g. Moshika,
by changing the `"hf_repo"` key in either file.

Once the server has printed 'standalone worker listening', you can use the web
UI. By default the rust version uses https so it will be at
[localhost:8998](https://localhost:8998).

You will get some warnings about the site being unsafe. When using chrome you
can bypass it by selecting "Details" or "Advanced", then "Visit this unsafe
site" or "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)".

## Clients

We recommend using the web UI as it provides some echo cancellation that helps
the overall model quality. Alternatively we provide some command line interfaces
for the rust and python versions, the protocol is the same as with the web UI so
there is nothing to change on the server side.

### Rust Command Line

From within the `rust` directory, run the following:
```bash
cargo run --bin moshi-cli -r -- tui --host localhost
```

### Python with PyTorch

```bash
python -m moshi.client
```

### WebUI

The web UI can be built from this repo via the
following steps (these will require `npm` being installed).
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run build
```

The web UI can then be found in the `client/dist` directory.
